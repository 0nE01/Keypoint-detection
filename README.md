### Detecting key points in animals body were always a challenge for human being.
### these key points can be used for body analysis or can be used for medical purposes.😎

### In this repo I trained a model for detecting keypoint for fish that can be used for finding almost every keypoint in fish body and after that those keypoint can be used for anything needed. 🔥
